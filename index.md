## **Greetings from Denmark!**
My name is Sam Chealier. I am currently a [Marie Curie Postdoctoral Research Fellow](https://marie-sklodowska-curie-actions.ec.europa.eu/calls/msca-postdoctoral-fellowships-2021) at the [Technical University of Denmark (DTU)](https://www.cee.elektro.dtu.dk/), where my research with [Spyros Chatzivasileiadis](http://www.chatziva.com/) focuses on developing data driven optimization and control strategies for low carbon electrical power sytems. Prior to DTU, I recieved my PhD ('21) from the [mechanical engineering department at MIT](https://meche.mit.edu/). In the fall of 2023, I will join the electrical engineering faculty at the [University of Vermont](https://www.uvm.edu/cems/ebe) (my Alma Mater!). For more information on my reasearch and background, you can [<ins>**download my CV here**</ins>](https://samchevalier.github.io/docs/Chevalier_CV.pdf).

### **★ Lab Recruitment ★**
In the fall of 2023, I will be launching my lab at UVM. I’m looking to build a strong team of mathematical innovators who are passionate about solving real-world power and energy system problems. I am recruiting up to 3 fully funded PhD students whose research will broadly focus on

- Network compression and optimization
- Machine learning performance verification 
- Aggregated distributed energy resource dynamics

If these topics excite you, please reach out to me directly at **schevali [at] uvm.edu** for more information. In your email, please include your CV along with a short explanation about why you are interested in doing a PhD in electrical engineering.
