## **Greetings from Vermont!**
My name is [**Sam Chevalier**](https://samchevalier.github.io/redirect/). I am an assistant professor of [electrical engineering](https://www.win.tue.nl/~wscor/woeginger/P-versus-NP.htm) and an affiliate of the [Complex Systems Institutue](https://vermontcomplexsystems.org/) at the [University of Vermont](https://www.uvm.edu/cems/ebe) (my [Alma Mater](https://samchevalier.github.io/photos/uvm_igert.jpg)!) where I run the **Grid Verification** Lab. We focus on problems at the intersection power grid optimization and machine learning verification. Until fall of 2023, I was a [Marie Curie Postdoctoral Fellow](https://marie-sklodowska-curie-actions.ec.europa.eu/calls/msca-postdoctoral-fellowships-2021) at the [Technical University of Denmark](https://www.cee.elektro.dtu.dk/) (DTU) with [Spyros Chatzivasileiadis](http://www.chatziva.com/). Prior to DTU, I recieved my PhD ('21) from the [mechanical engineering department at MIT](https://meche.mit.edu/). For more information, [<ins>**download my CV**</ins>](https://samchevalier.github.io/docs/Chevalier_CV.pdf).

I presently chair the [**Power and Energy Society (PES)**](https://site.ieee.org/gms-pes/) chapter of the [IEEE Green Mountain Section](https://site.ieee.org/gm/) (mainly Vermont). Join us!

### **Lab research themes**
- designing industry-relevant **optimization & control** strategies for renewable-infused power grids<br/>
- building **trustworthy machine learning** tools for safety-critical engineering applications<br/>
- developing **data-driven modeling** techniques for the power & energy sectors<br/>

* <code>11/17/25</code>: [**Will**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13846) and [**Eren**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15624) both submitted papers to the 2026 PESGM. Will's paper focuses on designing distribution transformer upgrade schedules; Eren's paper uses interval bound propagation to bound security-constrained OPF solutions.
* <code>11/13/25</code>: Will and Sam were invited to present [their recent work](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07850) at the [**EIMC2 seminar series**](https://www.rahmankhorramfar.com/eimc2-seminars) at MIT. It was a tag-team presentation. Very fun!
* <code>10/27/25</code>: Sam was highlighted in a [**UVM CEMS news story**](https://www.uvm.edu/cems/ebe/news/deploying-trustworthy-machine-learning-power-systems) about his NSF CAREER grant
* <code>10/15/25</code>: Omid submitted his work on [**GPU-accelerated 3-phase network reduction**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19608) to PSCC'26
* <code>10/15/25</code>: Duncan, Sam, and LANL submitted their work on load shedding verification to PSCC'26

### **★ Lab Recruitment ★**
In the fall of 2023, I launched my lab at UVM. I’m looking to build and maintain a strong team of fully funded mathematical innovators who are passionate about solving real-world (i) power grid, (ii) network optimization, and (iii) ML verification problems. If these topics excite you, reach out to me at **schevali [at] uvm.edu**.
